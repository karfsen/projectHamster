# projectHamster

If you want to run this project-
0. you need to have mysql installed on your computer, then create database hamster and add structure by mysqldump
1. you need to create own arduino setup with connecting it to your server(best is to run server on cloud)
2. you need to run server on some port and then put it into every JS file of frontend(default port for this project is 1206)
